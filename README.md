Here I'll dump animations and tools to create them


For the manifest creator you should replace the list of names you are creating manifests for and save the file as .py, then run it with python!
When the Manifest is created you need to add:
Filetype: Flipper Animation Manifest
Version: 1
at the top of the txt file!!!
